### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

The journey of learning to code has been difficult as I had to find my discipline and patience towards developing better problem solving skills. Whether it was researching optimal solutions, simply trying to comprehend a new concept or having the mental discipline to push forward. Thatâ€™s the beauty of coding, no matter how much you know there is always more to learn.

I fell in love with coding because it stimulates and challenges my mind in ways that I never thought was possible. I began seeing things differently, slowly learning to break them down into their individual components. So an action of getting into a car can be split from 1 'step into multiple steps that can have various if-checks and other logical variables to consider.

I started out as a self-tought front-end developer and in 2022 manged to get into Founder And Coders pre-apprenticeship/apprenticeship program to become a full stack Developer

languages i worked with: 
HTML 
CSS
SASS
JS

-Iâ€™m currently learning: React JS in my spare time.

-Iâ€™m currently working on challenges set by Founder and Coders program.
